# Session Capability Boundary

## Status

Implemented incrementally. Contract version 4 production-mounts the sealed
`interaction.side_question` facet and adopts the existing transcript lifecycle
trio as one indivisible binding. It also consumes the admitted Resources
Bundle and the optional Product-admitted Workspace Bundle through focused
dependency facets. Generic Products do not acquire a synthetic Workspace;
Process continuity retains its Process owner.

## Version 4 Decision

`harness.session` version 4 has seven facets and five focused Consumers:

| Facet | Provider input | Consumer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `interaction.side_question` | one Product-admitted, root-owned `LegacySideQuestionBinding` candidate | `SessionSideQuestionCapabilityConsumer` |
| `conversation.store` | the existing root-owned transcript lifecycle candidate | `SessionTranscriptCapabilityConsumer` |
| `agent.transcript_profile` | the same transcript lifecycle candidate | `SessionTranscriptCapabilityConsumer` |
| `context.compaction` | the same transcript lifecycle candidate and dynamic selected mechanism | `SessionTranscriptCapabilityConsumer` |
| `resource.composition` | one declared `harness.resources` dependency view | `SessionResourceCompositionCapabilityConsumer` |
| `workspace.tool_operations` | one optional declared `harness.workspace` dependency view | `SessionWorkspaceToolCapabilityConsumer` |
| `workspace.process_launch` | the same optional Workspace dependency view | `SessionWorkspaceProcessCapabilityConsumer` |

The Product construction root resolves the side-question factory and binds the
transcript Store/Profile/Compaction trio once, before AgentProduct graph
construction. The combined Session Provider constructs neither a second
Runtime Profile Binder nor another Store. It transfers both focused candidates
through these states:

```text
root_owned -> graph_constructing -> graph_owned -> disposed
```

Validation or construction failure restores `root_owned`. Graph-wide or node
reuse never calls the Provider factory, so the rejected candidate remains
root-owned and is disposed by the construction root. After publication, only
the Graph Provider disposer may release it. A failed disposer retains the
same owner state so the existing Graph retirement retry can try again.

The selected side-question factory is bound to the live Product Session only
inside Provider construction. The binding callback is a narrow typed port; it
is not part of the Provider fingerprint, graph snapshot, diagnostics, or
runtime projection. The fingerprint contains only the canonical focused
Profile snapshot, Capability/provider versions, and redacted scope identity.

The Consumer revalidates its `CapabilityFacetSet` lease on every `ask`,
`cancel`, and ownership query. It never returns the raw coordinator or selected
Provider. Session shutdown cancels and joins an active request before Graph
retirement; Provider disposal repeats that operation idempotently before
releasing the Profile binding.

The three transcript facets deliberately share one facet implementation and
one disposer because `AgentTranscriptProfileRuntime.bind_lifecycle()` binds
them as one unit. Model Input and compaction callers use a stable narrow port:
before Mount, synchronous compaction reads the root-owned candidate; after the
single Graph publication window, Model Input and compaction revalidate the
typed transcript Consumer lease on each use. The durable transcript header,
Runtime Profile snapshot, Store identity, UoW, and Model Input record schema
are unchanged and are not persisted as Graph facts.

The two transcript Runtime-binding fields used by this handoff are additive.
A generic Product that still returns the earlier Store/key/profile/binding/
disposer shape receives a stable `harness.transcript.legacy` selection snapshot
and its previously selected custom-or-default compaction capability. This keeps
the old AgentProduct path constructible without pretending that legacy Product
facts came from the standard Profile resolver.

Session shutdown first joins active compaction and side-question work. The
Provider then attempts auxiliary index publication before releasing the
transcript binding. Failed runtime disposers retain only the failed entries and
the graph-owned candidate, so Graph retirement can retry without repeating
successful cleanup.

The Session Provider declares one aggregate Resources requirement covering the
resource runtime, skill activation, prompt sections, Tool packs, and Command
packs. Provider construction wraps that least-authority dependency in a private
method-only facet; it does not expose the raw dependency binding or install
external ports. After Graph publication, `AgentProductSession` captures one
generation-scoped Session Resource Consumer and switches the existing stable
resource ports to it in the same no-await publication window. Bootstrap calls
before Mount continue to use the single root-owned Resource candidate. After
Mount, every resource call follows `Session Consumer -> Session facet ->
Resources dependency` and becomes stale with the Session generation.

The production dependency closure is therefore
`harness.model_input -> harness.session -> harness.resources`. Resources is no
longer a peer root. Resource content remains call data: content-only refresh
changes the scoped source-publication reference without rebinding the Graph or
changing Mount generation.

The same Provider declares one optional aggregate Workspace requirement. When
a Product supplies an admitted Workspace Provider, it projects two separate
least-authority Session facets for filesystem operations and authorized process
launch. The private facets retain the raw dependency view; public Consumers and
stable ports revalidate the Session lease for every operation or process start.
When no Workspace Provider exists, the Planner omits the optional dependency
and both facets fail closed without creating a Workspace node. The Session
Provider never owns or disposes the borrowed Workspace mechanisms; the
Session-owned Graph remains responsible for retiring the Workspace node.

Production roots are therefore only `harness.model_input`. The realized Coding
closure is `model_input -> session -> {resources, workspace}`; a generic Product
has the same root with only the required Resources dependency. Workspace
authority-ceiling facts flow through dependency signatures into Session and
Model Input Mount identity, while raw policy, approval, Sandbox, and process
host objects remain outside the Session Bundle.

## Deferred Work

- `continuity.provider_packs` is Process-scoped and is released by the Product
  runtime, not by an individual Session. A later Session Consumer may receive
  only a typed stable lease/reference from that process owner. The concrete
  ContinuityHub must not be inserted into the Session Bundle.

## Dependency And Import Rules

- Definition imports only neutral Capability contracts.
- Provider may import the focused legacy binding and side-question runtime
  contracts, but not Coding, Graph Runtime/Binder/Planner/Projector, Product
  services, or a service locator.
- Consumer holds only a requirement-scoped `CapabilityFacetSet`; it does not
  import the Provider or a graph manager.
- `AgentProductSession` remains the only production Graph/Binder/Projector
  owner and the only Provider-construction/Consumer-capture site.
- Version 4 directly consumes required `harness.resources` and optional
  `harness.workspace`, and is itself a direct dependency of
  `harness.model_input`. Missing optional Workspace input never becomes an
  unavailable placeholder node.

## Acceptance Evidence

- standard, Extension-selected, direct-construction, and absent Provider paths;
- graph construction failure, cancellation, pre-publication rollback, reuse
  rejection, disposal retry, and stale Consumer lease;
- active request cancellation and join before factory disposal;
- one graph bind and one Provider construction for one signature; and
- durable transcript resume remains independent of the auxiliary
  side-question selection;
- new/load/open/continue/in-memory/fork preserve the same transcript binding,
  header and Model Input reconstruction behavior; and
- index publication precedes transcript release, failed cleanup is retryable,
  and cached transcript Consumer leases become stale after retirement;
- all five Session resource operations traverse the declared dependency and a
  cached Session Resource Consumer becomes stale after retirement; and
- generic and Coding roots contain only `harness.model_input`; Coding realizes
  Workspace through the Session dependency closure; and
- cached Workspace operation and launcher proxies become stale with the
  Session generation, while the Workspace Provider remains the sole owner of
  its cleanup.
